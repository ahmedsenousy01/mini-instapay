# Default scrape_configs in the promtail chart are usually good for k8s
# We can add extra relabel_configs if needed later for specific metadata handling
# Example:
# extraScrapeConfigs:
#   - job_name: my-custom-app
#     static_configs:
#       - targets:
#           - localhost
#         labels:
#           __path__: /var/log/my-custom-app.log

# Ensure Promtail has permissions to read logs from all nodes/pods
# The chart usually sets up appropriate RBAC (ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, ServiceAccount)

# If running on Minikube, sometimes Promtail needs specific volume mounts if default paths are different
# For example, if Minikube mounts Docker logs differently.
# Default chart values usually handle common setups.
# Example for Minikube if /var/log/pods is not standard (less common now):
# extraVolumeMounts:
#  - name: varlogpods
#    mountPath: /var/log/pods
#    hostPath:
#      path: /var/log/pods # Or minikube specific path
#  - name: varlogcontainers
#    mountPath: /var/log/containers
#    hostPath:
#      path: /var/log/containers # Or minikube specific path

# Ensure promtail runs as a DaemonSet to cover all nodes
# This is the default for the grafana/promtail chart.
